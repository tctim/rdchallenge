# rdchallenge - by timothy campbell
A very simple execution of a programming challenge, done  with php, jquery and the ratchet framework.

Websocket implementation done with Ratchet: http://socketo.me/

Rememeber to uncomment "extension=php_sockets.dll" in your php.ini file.   
*IE: from ";extension=php_sockets.dll" to "extension=php_sockets.dll"*

Also to run this, in your command prompt navigate to the bin folder and execute "php server.php" to get the websocket running.  
Example: (after starting your apache/xampp) ***cd c:/xampp/htdocs/websocket/bin*** then run ***php server.php***
